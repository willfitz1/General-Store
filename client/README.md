## **_Welcome!_**

Welcome to my custom admin dashboard. I wanted to create an example of what a dashboard would look like on a site where sales would be made. Such as a dropshipper or reseller would see when handling their products. Theres a lot of style out there of simple and complex dashboards, but most of them look the same. I wanted to create my own style, and give it a new look for people who are creating and selling.

## **_Features_**

I plan on featuring a number of navigations that will be used, such as profile, settings, log out and log in. It will be interactive, such as hovering over certain blocks and having them react a certain way (ie. glowing, outlined, bg changed, etc.) It will also be able to be easily visbile on both ios and standard displays.
